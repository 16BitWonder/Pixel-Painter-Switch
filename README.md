# Pixel-Painter

Note: v1.7.0 and all previous versions of Pixel-Painter are deprecated, and will not function on firmware 9.0.0 and above.
Please use the master branch instead: https://github.com/16BitWonder/Pixel-Painter-Switch/tree/master

My first Switch homebrew application, a port of my 3DS application [Pixel-Painter](https://github.com/16BitWonder/Pixel-Painter).  
Uses the hello-world template from [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) as a base.

Features: 
- The ability to draw with seven different colors on the screen
- Controls and color information on the left side of the screen
