# Pixel-Painter
My first Switch homebrew application, a port of my 3DS application [Pixel-Painter](https://github.com/16BitWonder/Pixel-Painter).
Uses the hello-world template from [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) as a base.

Features: 
- The ability to draw with six different colors on the screen
- Controls and color information on the left side of the screen
